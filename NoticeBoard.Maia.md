Greetings, adventurer! I'm Maia, your friendly Tavernemaid at Ye Olde Taverne. I've got some information that might be helpful to you.

- First of all, I noticed that you're looking for a way to get to the Forest of Wonders. Well, I've heard rumors of a hidden path that leads there, but I'm not sure where it is. Maybe you could try asking around town or checking the local bulletin board for clues?

- I also saw that you're interested in meeting new people. Well, you're in luck! Our tavern is always bustling with interesting characters. You might want to try striking up a conversation with the bard, ASLO, or perhaps Ajax, the leader of the Hammerhead Mercenaries faction. They both seem like they might be open to chatting and sharing some adventure stories.

- Oh, and I almost forgot! I've heard that there's a mysterious figure lurking around the tavern who's looking for brave souls to undertake perilous missions. Might be worth keeping an eye out for them, if you're feeling adventurous.

- I hope this information helps, adventurer! If you have any other questions or need any more tips, just let me know. I'm always here to help.

## Best regards,

# Maia
